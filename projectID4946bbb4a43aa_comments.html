The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santal">Santals</a> are a people in Central India, speaking their own Austro-Asiatic language (Santali), quite different from the surrounding Indo-European languages (Hindi, Bengali, Oriya). Their unique culture has been a subject of study, and already PG includes one book on them, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/11938">Folklore of the Santal Parganas by Cecil Henry Bompas</a>. This book is again an welcome addition to the available materials in our collection.

<p>Have fun!</BODY></HTML>
